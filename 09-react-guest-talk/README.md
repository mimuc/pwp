# Werner Huber's Peek Into ReactJS #

TS: I've tried to code along during the talk. This directory contains the code examples. 

## Usage ##
1. Run `npm insall`
2. In the root folder, run `npm start`. A browser window opens. 
3. If you change files in the `src` directory, the browser refreshes automagically.
